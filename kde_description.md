# Plasma Audio Visualizer

A modern, customizable audio visualizer widget for KDE Plasma 6. It renders a mirrored waveform reacting in real-time to whatever audio is playing system-wide, alongside complete MPRIS track info, album art, transport controls, and a seekable progress bar.

### Features
* **5 Visualizer Styles:** Smooth Wave, Rounded Bars, Mirror Bars, Tech Line, Floating Dots, and Floating Dots Bold.
* **4 Progress Bar Styles:** Glassy Sleek (default), Ultra Minimal (thin 1px), Glowing Pulse (neon accent), and Bold Pill.
* **Smart Background Card:** Optional frosted card with customizable color, transparency (via color picker alpha), and corner radius.
* **High Contrast/Transparent Panel Friendly:** Visualizer styles adapt to work on transparent panels or over custom backgrounds.
* **System Accent Integration:** Automatically matches your Plasma system accent color and text colors (or set your own custom colors).

### Requirements

1. **cava** (console audio visualizer) — to generate the raw waveform bars.
2. **flock** (from `util-linux`) and **pkill** (from `procps`) — standard utilities pre-installed on virtually all Linux distributions.
